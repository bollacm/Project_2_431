# Future of Dart

  The future for Dart seems that it has a lot of potential, considering its current standing of usage within the scope of application building. Dart is still receiving support and updates semi-monthly, with Dart 3.6 just being announced December 11th, the day this segment was written. Dart 3.6 promises some new features:

## Pub Workspaces

"Pub now supports shared resolution between packages in a monorepo, or workspace. A workspace is a tightly related group of packages developed, resolved, and released together.
The pub workspaces feature ensures that packages in a monorepo share a consistent set of dependencies. This forces you to resolve dependency conflicts between your grouped packages as they arise, rather than facing confusion when you start using the packages.."

## Pub download counts

" The download count replaces the previous “popularity score” on individual package pages. Along with the new metric, you will also find a sparkline chart on each page, showing weekly downloads over time."

## Digit Separators

" The download count replaces the previous “popularity score” on individual package pages. Along with the new metric, you will also find a sparkline chart on each page, showing weekly downloads over time."
